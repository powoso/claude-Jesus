Daily Walk — Jesus & Bible


SHORT DESCRIPTION (80 chars max):
Grow closer to Jesus daily with devotionals, prayer journal & Scripture memory.


FULL DESCRIPTION:
Daily Walk is your sacred digital space for growing closer to Jesus — one day at a time.

No ads. No social media. No distractions. Just you and God.

Whether you're a new believer or have walked with Christ for decades, Daily Walk provides a beautiful, private sanctuary for deepening your relationship with Jesus through six powerful spiritual disciplines.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✦ DAILY DEVOTIONALS
Start each morning with a fresh Bible verse and guided reflection questions. With 365 unique verses covering themes of Faith, Hope, Love, Grace, Wisdom, and more — you'll never run out of daily encouragement. Journal your thoughts and prayers right alongside each day's Scripture.

✦ PRAYER JOURNAL
Organize your prayer life with seven categories: Gratitude, Intercession, Confession, Petition, Praise, Healing, and Guidance. Track active prayers, mark them as answered, and build a beautiful timeline of God's faithfulness in your life.

✦ BIBLE READING PLANS
Follow structured reading plans with daily passages and visual progress tracking. See how far you've come and stay motivated with reading streaks and estimated completion dates.

✦ SCRIPTURE MEMORY STUDIO
Memorize God's Word with a science-backed spaced repetition system — the same proven method used by top language learners worldwide. Three practice modes (First Letter hints, Fill in the Blank, and Full Recall) exercise different memory pathways so verses truly stick in your heart.

✦ GRATITUDE WALL
Capture moments of thankfulness on a beautiful, colorful wall. Look back at "This Time Last Year" entries to remember God's blessings across seasons.

✦ SPIRITUAL GROWTH TRACKER
See your growth visually with weekly check-ins across five dimensions: Prayer, Scripture Reading, Worship, Service, and Fellowship. Beautiful charts reveal patterns and progress over time — with gentle encouragement, never guilt.
